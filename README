NetBIOS Security Kit

The intention of this package is to perform various security checks on
remote servers running NetBIOS file sharing services. This particular
package is for pre-release distribution only and is by no means suitable for
public use. We assume that our users at this point are other 'security
proffesionals'. As such there is precious little documentation with this
release.  

Some things you will need to know. 

- Netbios_check is fairly verbose. You may be well served to pipe the stdout
  to both your screen and a file. The final release will have a shellscript
  front end will allow you to do just this (perhaps with tee(1) ?>.

- Password grinding can take a while. Be patient, or launch multiple passes
  at the same host. The final release will have this capability via a shell
  script.   

- If you feel the need to add more passwords to the grinding list, you have
  to add them manually to client.c. The final revision will allow the end
  user to supply their own list. 

- Netbios_check when run will look something like the following. Please note
  that explanations of the steps are denoted by [*] .
